# AI-Tic-Tack-Toe
This project is to experiment with producing AI's for basic games.

First up is Tic-Tac-Toe!

Your goal is to make a subclass of the included AI class and implement the move() method to compete against
other AI's that people have made. The AI class also has a name attribute which can be customized to
further distinguish your AI from others when the tests are running.

How to run a match:
1. Make sure that all the AI files are in the same directory as the other files and compile them together
2. You will be prompted for the name of the AI, type in your file name without the .java extention
    ex: TestAI.java would be entered as "TestAI"
3. Sit back an enjoy! The board will be printed out for each move.

Every so often I will update this file with the AI who does the best.

Current AI to beat : TestAI (It randomly selects moves so it should not be hard to beat)
